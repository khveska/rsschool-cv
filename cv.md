I'm a keen learner and after some deliberate thoughts, I chose to make an attempt to pursue Frontend Development path since it involves frequent gain of new information and has low chances in allowing you to become rusty during your career. Javascript/Typescript is fast evolving language and in connection with other web development tools gives an oportunity to create amazing websites, solve different tasks (e.g. complex math problems) and in overall gives you general awareness what is this magic behind web pages being visited by you daily.
